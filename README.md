# OSRS Pathfinder Prototype Project

This is a webapplication featuring a map of the game Old School Runescape with pathfinding features.

The [frontend](https://github.com/OlZe/osrs_pathfinder_frontend) is served as a static client-side rendered website.

The backend uses .json files to read previously dumped OSRS map data, build a graph and perform shortest path algorithms upon.

# Usage

This is a Spring Boot application.

Once started, go to http://localhost:8080/frontend/index.html
